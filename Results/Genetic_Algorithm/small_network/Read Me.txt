NSABC Algorithm:
Random seed = 42
Number of employed bees = 15
Number of nodes in the network = 20
Number of buses = 5
Minimum number of buses = 4
Maximum number of buses = 7
Iterations = 1000
Improvement limit = 150 iterations
Two methods were applied - 
1. changing limit and changing objective function weights (105 total possibilities)
2. pareto dominant solutions using uniform objective function weights and limit of 50 - archive with the pareto optimal solutions is outputed

In the first option the output are the paths dictionaries of every limit and weight combination and a file with the results of each combination.
