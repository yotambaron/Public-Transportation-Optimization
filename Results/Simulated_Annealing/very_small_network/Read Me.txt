SA Algorithm:
We ran 10 permutations with seed starting at 42 and increasing by 3 in every permutation.
TI = 300 starting temperature
TL = 150 number of iterations at every temperature
Temperature threshold = 1 if the temperature drops below the process stops
Number of nodes in the network = 10
Number of buses = 3
Minimum number of buses = 4
Maximum number of buses = 6
Iterations = 1000

Two methods were applied - 
1. changing decrease rate and changing objective function weights (84 total possibilities)
2. pareto dominant solutions using uniform objective function weights and decrease rate of 0.85 - archive with the pareto optimal solutions is outputed

In the first option the output are the paths dictionaries of every limit and weight combination and a file with the results of each combination.
